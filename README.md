# SPL251 – Assignment 1: Reconstruction Simulation

This project was completed as part of the Systems Programming course (SPL251) at Ben-Gurion University – Fall 2024.  
It implements a simulation system for planning and executing the reconstruction of war-damaged settlements in SPLand.

## 🧠 Project Goal

The goal is to design and implement an object-oriented simulation in C++ that handles:
- Settlements (villages, cities, metropolis)
- Reconstruction plans with selection strategies
- Construction of various facilities
- Simulation steps and policy switching
- User-defined actions via CLI
